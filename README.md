# vr-10system
this is our 10 system script for fivem.

the script works only with QBCore Framewrok.

there is a very comfortable menu for the players.
at the config you can find what ever you need and its work with multiply jobs that you can choose at the config.
if you want for players to see what radio channel they are talking throw the list you have to change the events at the config.
